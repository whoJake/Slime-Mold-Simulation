# Slime-Mold-Simulation

A project that I pitched and then executed for COMP6590 Computational Creativity in my final year at university. The breif was to design and implement a computationally creative piece of software and then evaluate in the report whether what you created exhibits creative behaviour.
I chose to go down the path of emergent behaviour and so designed and programmed a simulation of the slime mold Physarum using Processing 3. This slime mold
exhibits behaviours in a similar vein to ants, and expands dependent on variables related to trails left by other parts of the organism.

Since I had to write a report on how I designed this software, the repository contains several versions of it in various stages of development.
